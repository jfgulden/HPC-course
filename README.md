# HPC-course
Introduction to HPC Applications, Systems, and Programming Models

## Dictated by: 
Bernd Mohr – Jülich Supercomputing Center. Germany.

High-performance computing applications, systems and models.

## Brief summary of the subject.

In this introductory course, students will learn what high performance computing (HPC) is and what sets it apart from other areas of computing. A will be made
Introduction to the main application areas using HPC for research and industry, and how artificial intelligence (AI) and HPC interact with each other. The main HPC system architectures necessary to run these applications (distributed and shared memory systems, hybrid systems and heterogeneous systems) will be presented. In the main part of the course, students will be provided with an overview of the languages ​​and paradigms used to program HPC applications and systems. They will learn how to use MPI to program distributed memory systems (clusters) and how to use OpenMP for shared memory systems. The course will conclude with an introduction to methods and tools for performance analysis and debugging of parallel programs.
