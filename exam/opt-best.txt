For optimized execution, I would use the OMP program with 32 threads because it achieves a fast execution time with high efficiency, making it significantly better than any MPI program. Although the fastest OMP model (64 threads) has a slightly quicker execution time and higher speedup, it requires twice as many threads and has lower efficiency, making it less desirable. The hybrid model should be avoided because it not only performs poorly compared to the other two program types, but many hybrid combinations also lead to incorrect results, as shown in the spreadsheet.
