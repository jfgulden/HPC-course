I recommend using the hybrid model with 8 ranks and 16 threads because it minimizes the number of MPI processes, balancing performance with cost and making it an efficient choice for HPC environments. Although it doesn't offer the highest speedup or efficiency, with an execution time of 0.079 seconds, it stands out as one of the best configurations overall. This approach leverages both process- and thread-level parallelism, enabling efficient use of system resources, especially considering that threads have lower memory overhead and offer more efficient context switching compared to processes.
